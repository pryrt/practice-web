## Alternates

### Action Deployment

The docs above (starting at [QuickStart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)) describe how to use a manual action to deploy, instead of using Jekyll to deploy

### Hugo

[Hugo: Hosting on GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) describes how to use an Action to deploy with Hugo; that could be useful for me to try to replicate npp-usermanual, but using github pages

## Custom Domain

The instructions above (starting at [QuickStart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)) also explain how to use a custom URL, so I could do XXXX.pryrt.com as my whole gh-pages holder.  I _think_ with the custom domain that it's then a separate subdomain for each project (and thus separate from the user pages at username.github.io project)
